# --- Original code modifications start here ---
# The provided changes are a complete replacement of the main execution block
# and imports, which implies a significant restructuring.
# I will apply the changes as a full replacement of the content from the changes snippet.

# Note: The provided 'changes' snippet seems to be a full replacement
# of the existing main block and imports, including some duplicated imports and configurations.
# I will prioritize applying the *intent* of the changes which is to add a new scheduler.
# The original code already had threading and asyncio imports, and also a run_notification_scheduler function.
# The new changes introduce `reminder_scheduler` and `run_reminder_scheduler`.

# Let's re-evaluate the provided changes in context of the original code.
# The original code has:
# import threading, time, asyncio
# def run_notification_scheduler(): ... asyncio.run(notification_scheduler())
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#   ...
#   scheduler_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_notification_scheduler, daemon=True)
#   scheduler_thread.start()
#   ... run_bot()

# The changes snippet provided is a complete replacement of the imports and the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
# This suggests the user wants to discard the original structure and use the new one.
# I will reconstruct the file using the new imports and the new main block from the changes.

# --- Reconstructing based on the provided changes snippet ---
